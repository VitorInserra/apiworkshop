# Hack110 Fall 2022 API Workshop

### Setup

This is a demo for APIs using Python's requests library. Before we get started, you should download the library using `pip install requests` if prompted, you should update pip to the latest version using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`. Once that's done you can import the requests library into your Python file using import requests.
